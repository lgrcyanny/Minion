Minion
======

Minion is a personalized recommendation engine based on multi agent platform Jadex. It's kind of a creative way to build recommendation engine.
The Recommendation algorithm is the classic collobrative filtering algorithm based on Mahout.

Multi Agents
====
The Minion system now has 5 agents, all of them are built with the BDIAgent, BDI is Belief, Desire(Goal) and Intention(Plan).<BR>
Multi Agent System(MAS) is different from object-oriented system, which is usually single Thread. MAS system is concurrent, and each Agent is intellent, sociality, autonomy and focus on its BDI. Based on Multi Agent, the recommendation engine can be more personalized.<Br>
The Agents in the Minion system:<BR>

+ UserBDI
Provide UserInterface  to get user input and behaviors
+ RecommendBDI
Controll the whole process of generating recommendations. Make use of the services provided by DataMiningBDI, SearchBDI and RecommendationBuildBDI.
+ DataMiningBDI
Make use of UserBased Algorithm, ItemBased Algorithm and SlopOne Algorithm which are provided by Mahout to generate recommended items.
+ SearchBDI
Since the Recommended Items generated by DataMiningBDI is not detail enough. The SearchBDI search Database to generated details about the recommended items.
+ RecommendationBuildBDI
Build recommendation results for Display.

BTW, these agents is communicated with active components using service interface. See more about the mechanism on [Jadex Tutorial](http://www.activecomponents.org/bin/view/BDI+V3+Tutorial/07+Using+Services)

The Data Set
========
The Minion system adopts the [MovieLens 1M dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).


Installation
==============
The following steps is available for MacOS or Linux system.
1. git clone https://github.com/lgrcyanny/Minion

2. Config dataset:
+ Install MySQL
+ Download [MovieLens 1M dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
+ Create database movielens
+ Import the movielens.sql into database:
```sh
$ mysql -u root -proot movielens < movielens.sql

```
+ Import the 1M data into database
```sh
$ mysql -u root -p
mysql>  load data local infile 'ratings.dat' into table tbl_ratings fields terminated by '::'  enclosed by '' lines terminated by '\n' (userid, movieid, rating, timestamp);
mysql>  load data local infile 'movies.dat' into table tbl_movies fields terminated by '::'  enclosed by '' lines terminated by '\n' (movieid, title, genres);
mysql>  load data local infile 'users.dat' into table tbl_users fields terminated by '::'  enclosed by '' lines terminated by '\n' (userid, gender, age, occupation, zipcode);
```

3. Download [Eclipse IDE for Java EE DevelopersEclipse IDE for Java EE Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

4. Run maven build on Minion project, then all dependencies will be downloaded automatically.

5. Run Minion Application
Open Run configurations, choose project: mas-recomm-engine, Main class jadex.base.Starter

6. After the Jadex Control Center(JCC) opened, add the classpath which is like "mas-recomm-engine-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"

7. Start All Agents and you can enjoy the recommendation engine.

The installation is complicated, good luck and be careful.
